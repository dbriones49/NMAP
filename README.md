# NMAP


## Introduction

NMAP is a powerful network scanning tool used by cybersecurity professionals to identify open ports, services, and potential vulnerabilities on a network. It can be used to conduct comprehensive security audits, monitor network activity, and detect potential threats or unauthorized access. With its extensive range of features and customization options, NMAP is a valuable tool for enhancing the overall security posture of an organization's network infrastructure.

Examples of scans will not be executed or shown here as doing so can be seen as intrusive and potentially unethical, as it involves probing a network without permission.  Therefore I will only explain some command and their purpose.
